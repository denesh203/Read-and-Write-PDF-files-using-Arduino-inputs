# Read-and-Write-PDF-files-using-Arduino-inputs
This is a small demo section of my project where I used Arduino to read a specific PDF file in a C# application. There are two PDFs, PDF1 and PDF2. When LED1 is on, the application will open PDF1 and write some error code, and the same applies to PDF2.
